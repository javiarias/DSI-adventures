# Pointer input sample (basic)

This sample supports the [Pointer input](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/input/handle-pointer-input) topic on the [Windows Dev Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows).

In this sample, we demonstrate how to track pointer input in a basic UWP application that displays property and event details for each pointer. 

We focus on the following:
* Tracking multiple pointers 
* Pointer properties and events
